🚀 OrangeHRM Automation using Java Selenium with POM Framework 🚀
📝 Project Overview
This project automates the testing of the OrangeHRM software using Java and Selenium WebDriver. The project follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern with PageFactory to enhance test maintenance and reduce code duplication. The framework is structured to support easy scalability and readability.
