## Overview

This project automates the testing of the **OpenHRM** web application using **Selenium WebDriver**, based on the **Page Object Model (POM)** and **Page Factory** design patterns. The framework is organized for scalability and easy maintenance, making it a robust choice for automated HR management application testing.

### Key Features:
- **Page Object Model (POM)** to organize web page actions and elements.
- **Page Factory** to initialize web elements in a more efficient manner.
- **TestNG** for running and organizing tests.
- Automates common actions on the **OpenHRM** web application, including login, employee management, and HR features.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure the following are installed:

- **Java 8+** (JDK)
- **Maven** for managing dependencies and build automation
- **Selenium WebDriver** (automatically managed by Maven)
- **TestNG** for test execution
- A web browser (e.g., **Chrome**, **Firefox**) and the corresponding WebDriver (e.g., **ChromeDriver** for Chrome).
### Key Updates:

1. **Project Purpose**: The README now highlights that the project is designed to automate the **OpenHRM** website.
2. **Test Execution**: Instructions on how to run the tests via **TestNG** are updated to reflect the test execution flow for **OpenHRM** automation.
2. **Test Data**: The README hints at the use of external test data (e.g., employee data), which might be stored in the `/TestData` folder.
