# Java Selenium Project with Page Object Model (POM) and Page Factory

This repository contains an automation framework for Selenium WebDriver based on the ** Page Object Model (POM)** pattern with **Page Factory**. It is designed to automate browser interactions for functional testing of web applications.
## Overview

This project is built using **Java**, **Selenium WebDriver**, and **TestNG** for test execution. The Page Object Model (POM) is used to structure the code in a maintainable way, where each page of the web application is represented by a class. **Page Factory** is utilized to initialize web elements on the page in a more efficient manner.

### Key Features:
- **Page Object Model (POM)** for code organization
- **Page Factory** for efficient element initialization
- Test automation using **Selenium WebDriver** and **TestNG**
- Clean separation between the test logic and the page logic

## Prerequisites

To get started with this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Java 8+** (JDK)
- **Maven** for dependency management and build automation
- **Selenium WebDriver** (automatically added via Maven)
- **TestNG** (for running tests)
- A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) with the corresponding WebDriver installed (e.g., ChromeDriver for Chrome)
